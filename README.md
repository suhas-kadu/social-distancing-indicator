# social-distancing-indicator

## Inspiration

Due to this pandemic people have started taking their extra care. They wear masks use sanitizers. But this is not enough. In public places they don't follow social distancing rules. But wait, what is Social Distancing?. Social Distancing is maintaining physical distance between two or more individuals. Many people don't follow social distancing., so this project is for those people. This project can be used by individual person and it can also be installed in public places.

## What it does

This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance two individuals. If two persons don't maintain 6 feet(180 cm) distance between them then an alarm will start.

## How we built it

This project is built on Tinkercad which is a online platform for building circuits.  I have used Arduino UNO, HC - SR04 Ultrasonic sensor for this project. I have embedded C for coding.
